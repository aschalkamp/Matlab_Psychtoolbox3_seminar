# Matlab_Psychtoolbox3_seminar

I created this code and the respective report for the research seminar "Seminar Experimentalprogrammierung (mit
MATLAB und Psychtoolbox-3)" at the University of Tuebingen during the summer semester of 2019. The task was to come up with an experiment and implement it using the Psychtoolbox.

I included a toy dataset such that the experiment can be executed.

## Requirements
Matlab version 2019b

Psychtoolbox 3 version 3.0.15
